## Code Validation

### Python

I have used the recommended [PEP8 CI Python Linter](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com) to validate all of my Python files.

| File | CI URL | Screenshot | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| run.py | [PEP8 CI](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Maxcode0101/QuizMaster-Battle-of-Brains-/refs/heads/main/run.py) | ![screenshot](documentation/testing/linter-testing-run.png) | Pass: No Errors |
| questions.py | [PEP8 CI](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Maxcode0101/QuizMaster-Battle-of-Brains-/refs/heads/main/questionlist.py) | ![screenshot](documentation/testing/linter-testing-questionlist.png) | Pass: No Errors |
